#### How do I approach designing software?
	Designing a program must begin with a solid planning phase. The time saved by a little research at the start of a project greatly influences the timely completion of a project. For example, there glew library is easy to setup, but there are more robust libraries, like glut, that can assist when creating of more complex shapes.

#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
	During this project I learned to do more research prior to starting a project. There are specialized methods that could make it much easier to create certain shapes.
 
#### What design process did you follow for your project work?
	 The project was broken down into milestones, and every milestone added a little more complexity. Starting with a simple primitive shape, to a multiple shape object, then adding color, multiple objects, textures, camera movement, and lighting.
  
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
	The divide and conquer approach is key to creating a large and complex project. Even though a project is massive, it is still comprised of smaller pieces that can be divided and worked on little by little. 

### How do I approach developing programs?
	One of the most intimidating aspects of programming is the first impression about creating a large project. I have encountered this numerous times throughout the many courses I have taken. First, you are presented with this idea you are supposed to create that seems unsurmountable. However, the more you learn about the part of the project, the easier it becomes to put together the pieces to create something larger. Therefore, it is important to see the project a second time and not let the first impression deter you from getting started.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
	I tried to make my code as reusable as possible. This would allow me to reuse the code and save me time in the long run. For example, the fragment shader is reused with all shapes to attach two different textures, one solid texture overlayed with a second texture with transparencies to make the pieces look rusty.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
	Creating backup files and testing the program constantly kept me from creating situations in which I broke the program beyond repair. There was a time when I removed some of the header files and setup files from the project, but luckily, I had a backup and was able to recover and continue to iterate with a previous version of the project.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
	Research and continue to learn more about the tools available at your disposal. After learning the basics, you will learn there are better ways or tools that enable you to accomplish the task more efficiently. However, it is important to have at least a core understanding of a concept before moving on to more advanced techniques. Doing so without comprehending how to use certain tools can end up doing more harm than good. 

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
	Troubleshooting is a constant task in computer science, and it can easily be transferred to any other career field. I think that is what I enjoy the most about computer science, figuring out what is wrong with a program, making a small step towards a greater goal, and learning how to tackle problems in new and innovative ways, at least for me as I learn more about programming.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
	I would like to start using Unity and Blender again. There are some many correlations between the knowledge gained in through this course and the tools utilized by these two programs. 

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
	Ultimately, I would like to create educational games and applications that seamlessly teach people in fun way, even without realizing they are learning. For example, a crafting game in which you must collect minerals, but your inventory is arranged as the periodic table, and you must know the symbol for the mineral you are trying to collect to effectively find it and retrieve it.
